# Mathematics and Python Fundamentals for Machine Learning and Data Science

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and resources for a comprehensive course on mathematical and programming fundamentals essential for machine learning and data science. This is a course I've been teaching since 2021.

## Course Contents

The course is divided into several key areas:

### Python Programming
- Introduction to Python
- Data structures and algorithms
- NumPy, SciPy, and SymPy libraries

### Mathematics
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Statistics and Probability

### Data Analysis and Visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Data visualization with Matplotlib

### Machine Learning Fundamentals
- Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and improvement
- Clustering techniques

## Notebooks

The course material is presented in Jupyter notebooks, which include:

1. `2023_3_HMCIA_HL_Linear_Algebra.ipynb`: Linear algebra concepts and applications
2. `2023_3_HMCIA_HL-Intro-to-Python.ipynb`: Introduction to Python programming
3. `2023_3_HMCIA_HL_Calculus.ipynb`: Calculus fundamentals for machine learning

## Getting Started

To use these materials:

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed
3. Install required Python libraries: NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, Matplotlib
4. Open the notebooks in Jupyter to view and run the content

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of mathematics
- No prior programming experience required, but helpful
